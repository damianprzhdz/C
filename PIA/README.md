# UANL MAZE 
This is a simple but funny game that you would enjoy by solving this labyrinth by moving right, left, up and down.
One of the main reasons of the project is because we can develop several mazes with simple code, just we need our imagination and we can develop our maze in a 50x50 matrix with tones of posibilities.

## Instructions
- You move with w,a,s,d as in a normal game!
- Where "w" is up, "a" is right, "s" is down and "d" is left.
- The objectif is to find a way out , this way out is marked with the ">" symbol.
